Factfulness - Ten Reasons We're Wrong About the World is a book written by Hans Rosling, Ola Rosling, and Anna Rosling Rönnlund. 
Factfulness is all about knowing the difference between dramatic narrative and actual facts. 
Everyone gets bombarded with bad news every day making our world seem to keep getting worse. 
The authors present 10 steps to stay open-minded avoid excessive negativity and search for the real facts. 
They have also built Gapminder to keep fighting misconceptions by providing reliable data.

In my opinion this is a book that must be read by everyone. The authors display data which proves that our world is becoming 
a better place year after year. There are less people living in extreme poverty than 40 years ago, 90% of human population has 
access to safe drinking water, and more people have access to education. It's also a fact that our world is not perfect but I 
think it gives hope for a much better future.
