Hello blog! At long last! I got my very own blog! I have been using third party blogging services
on the web for quite a while but I decided to create my own thing to have complete control over the 
content and ownership. One of the problems of the modern era is that ownership has startd becoming 
something of the past. What is wrong with owning your stuff?

I am looking forward to start creating content for my website and expand it as it goes. There are so many things
to do and so little time but I will manage. Also, I need to move my old blog here. It's going to be very fun!
